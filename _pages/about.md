I'm a second year Ph.D. student in [Bristol PL Research Group](https://plrg-bristol.github.io/) at the University of Bristol. I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Meng Wang](https://mengwangoxf.github.io/) and [Cristina David](https://cristina-david.github.io/). I'm interested in programming languages, program analysis and software verification. I'm currently working on the automatic generation of safe and correct code by devising static analysis and leveraging the power of LLMs.

Before joining Bristol, I was an undergrad at Peking University supervised by [Zhenjiang Hu](https://zhenjiang888.github.io/) and [Yingfei Xiong](https://xiongyingfei.github.io/). I had a wonderful time conducting research on reasoning and optimising bidirection programs by using program calculation techniques.
