I'm a final year Ph.D. student in [Bristol PL Research Group](https://plrg-bristol.github.io/) at the University of Bristol. My research focuses on automatic program translation targeting Rust, leveraging static analysis, formal methods, and large language models (LLMs). I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Meng Wang](https://mengwangoxf.github.io/) and [Cristina David](https://cristina-david.github.io/).

Before joining Bristol, I was an undergrad at Peking University supervised by [Zhenjiang Hu](https://zhenjiang888.github.io/) and [Yingfei Xiong](https://xiongyingfei.github.io/). I had a wonderful time conducting research on reasoning and optimising bidirectional programs by using program calculation techniques.
